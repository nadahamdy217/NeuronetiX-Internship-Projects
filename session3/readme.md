# Data Visualization Project with Seaborn

## Overview
This project showcases various data visualization techniques using the Seaborn library in Python. The visualizations are aimed at exploring relationships within datasets and providing insights through graphical representations. The datasets utilized in this project include `fmri`, `titanic`, `iris`, and `tips`, each offering different perspectives on data analysis.

## Contents
- **Line Plots**: Analyze the relationship between two continuous variables over time.
- **Bar Plots**: Compare categorical data and summarize numerical values.
- **Histograms**: Display the distribution of numerical data.
- **Distribution Plots**: Visualize the probability distribution of a continuous variable.
- **Heatmaps**: Represent data in a matrix format to show relationships between variables.

## Visualizations

### Line Plot
A line plot illustrates changes in signal intensity over time using the `fmri` dataset. The visualization is enhanced by color coding and styles to represent different events and regions.

### Customized Bar Plot
This version of the bar plot differentiates fare prices by gender, offering a more nuanced look at how demographics influenced fare pricing.

### Histograms
The histogram visualizes the distribution of petal lengths in the `iris` dataset. It provides a clear representation of frequency and data spread.

### Distribution Plot
A distribution plot is generated using randomly created data to demonstrate the shape and spread of the data, providing insights into univariate distributions.
