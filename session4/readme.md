## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning will be performed using Excel, including:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting data types
- Standardizing entries for categorical variables

## Visualizations
The following visualizations will be created to analyze the data:

1. **Pivot Plot**: To summarize data and find trends across different demographics.
